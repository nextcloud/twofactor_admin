This is the official documentation of the `twofactor_admin` Nextcloud app. This app
allows admins to generate a one-time login code for users which they can use to
unlock their otherwise locked account. This is useful for situations where users lost
access to all of their factory or if two-factor authentication is enforced and there
is no other two-factor provider configured for the user.
